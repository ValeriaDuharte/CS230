SNHU CS230

The client was the Gaming Room. It is a a web application inspired by the 1980s game Win, Lose or Draw where teams can input answers, which objective is to move from Android to a web version to reach more people, while sticking to a set budget.
I did particularly well understanding and expressing the client’s main needs by breaking them down into a simple list to help clarify what needed to be done. The design document helped organize ideas and give a clear view of the project’s requirements. I would revise a more detailed analysis of things like performance on different browsers and devices could make the transition smoother.
I thought about what the users would need and how they would interact with the app because if the app is hard to use, users won’t engage with it. In the future, I will continue using techniques like pseudocode to plan my code and make sure I'm thinking through the process first.
